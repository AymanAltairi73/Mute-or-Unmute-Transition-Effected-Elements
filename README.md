Simple Mute | Unmute Transition:
---------------------------------
Creating a simple mute/unmute transition using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript adds interactivity to your audio elements. By incorporating this feature, users can easily control the audio playback experience on your web page with a smooth visual transition effect.

In this setup, a button allows users to toggle between muting and unmuting the audio playback. The CSS styling helps to visually indicate the mute state change, while the JavaScript functionality handles the actual muting/unmuting action and updates the button text accordingly.

By combining HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling and creating visual effects, and JavaScript for adding interactivity, you can enhance the user experience and make your audio elements more engaging and user-friendly. This simple yet effective implementation of mute/unmute transition is a great way to improve the functionality and aesthetics of your web page
